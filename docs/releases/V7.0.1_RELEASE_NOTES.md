# V7.0.1-alpha Release Notes ⭐ CURRENT STABLE

**Release Date:** 2026-01-09 @ 12:50 CST  
**Branch:** `feature/structure-logic-v7`  
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready

---

## 🎯 What's New

This release fixes **critical issues** with protected level calculation and reversal BOS detection based on ICT/SMC research.

### 5 Major Fixes

1. **Reversal BOS Triggers on Protected Level Break**
   - Structure flips the moment protected level is breached
   - Per SMC: Protected level break = structure invalidation
   - No longer requires crossover + protected break at same time

2. **Protected Levels Use Most Recent Swing**
   - Now uses `confirmedSwingLow`/`confirmedSwingHigh` (SMC correct)
   - "The swing low prior to BOS becomes the protected low"
   - Automatically trails with each continuation BOS

3. **Protected Levels Trail with Structure**
   - Updates when new swings confirm existing trend
   - Bullish: Higher Lows trail protected low UP
   - Bearish: Lower Highs trail protected high DOWN

4. **Immediate Continuation BOS**
   - Works in strong trending markets
   - Triggers when swing confirmed and price already beyond it
   - No more stuck protected levels in trends

5. **UI & Visibility Fixes**
   - Internal breaks use directional colors
   - Protected level lines visible and dynamic
   - Developing level lines cleanup properly
